                            <p>
                                MITK campus is located amidst the pastoral farm lands of Kundapura taluk at Moodlakatte, a typical village away from the noisy city limits, at the ancestral heritage property of the founder Late  I M Jayaram Shetty. Kundapur taluk is well known as a traditionally agriculture belt, with vast paddy fields interspersed with quietly meandering rivers bringing in rich diversity of humanity, livelihood and ecological significance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Sandwiched between the vibrant Arabian sea on the west and the mighty hills of Western Ghats, the surviving ever green forest range on the east, extending till the beautiful North Kanara district on the north and the world renowned education & business hub and district of Udupi on the south.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                MITK campus fills the void of Higher education in the Kundapura belt, paving the way to the realization of the educational aspirations of poor, local youth who cannot afford to pursue their studies in the metros or other bigger cities. This was the vision of the founder Late I M Jyaram Shetty, to provide qualitative higher education at affordable costs to the rural youth and prepare them to serve the nation in diverse capacities.
                            </p>
